## Edit stan models using R

This package facilitates editing of stan model code using R. This includes adding/removing blocks, extracting variable names, and inserting/removing lines.

Development of this package was inspired by the `<bi_model>` class in the [rbi](https://github.com/sbfnk/rbi) package.

## Installation

The development version can be installed using `pak`
```{r eval=FALSE}
pak::pak("epiforecasts/stanedit")
```

## Example

First we load a stan model and prepares it for editing using the functionality in this package.

```{r}
library("stanedit")
model_file_name <- system.file(package = "stanedit", "regression.stan")
reg <- stanedit(filename = model_file_name)
reg
```

Let's say we want to add standard normal priors for alpha and beta.
We can do this using

```{r}
insert_lines(reg,
  lines = c(
    "alpha ~ std_normal();",
    "beta ~ std_normal();"
  ), 
  after = 12
)
```
